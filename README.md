# Coolnut-Tetris
A quick and dirty Tetris game I created through Javascript and can be played in your browser.

This game was from a lesson via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw, but I added in a few extra features including:
- All 7 tetris pieces
- Score adjustment and line count
- Level adjustment (both in the beginning and as you play)
- Bug fixes including preventing rotation if pieces or walls prevent it from doing so
- "Height" adjustment where pregenerated pieces are added at the start for extra difficulty
- A game over and reset.
- A bit of extra-snarky text.

Controls (on keypad):
Left/right to move piece left or right
Up to rotate
Down to fast drop

HAVE FUN!
