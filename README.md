# Coolnut-Tetris
A quick and dirty Tetris game I created through Javascript and can be played in your browser. Download and put all the files in the same directory (leave the block images in the /blocks folder), then open the "index.html" file in any Web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.)

This game was from a lesson via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw, but I added in a few extra features including:
- All 7 tetris pieces
- Improved score adjustment based on level and simultaneous cleared lines as well as line count
- Level adjustment (both in the beginning and as you play)
- Bug fixes including preventing rotation if pieces or walls prevent it from doing so
- "Height" adjustment where pregenerated pieces are added at the start if you want an extra challenge
- A game over and reset.
- A bit of extra-snarky text.

6/18 UPDATE: Added statistics based on pieces added in play

6/19 UPDATE: Added graphics for the pieces. May need to be tweaked a bit so they don't look all faded.

FUTURE PLANS (may be subject to change):
-
- Extra difficulty by adding in occasional blocks and rows mid-game (similar to the Atari arcade Tetris)
- Two-player option?

Controls (on keypad):
Left/right to move piece left or right;
Up to rotate;
Down to fast drop

HAVE FUN!
